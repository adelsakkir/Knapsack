# Knapsack

This notebook illustrates the different algorithms that can be used to solve a knapsack problem.

The knapsack can be solved in two broad approaches -

Dynamic Programming, Branch and Bound Techniques for opitimal solution.
Heuristics - Evolutionary algorithms or greedy approaches for suboptimal but scalable solutions.
The sections below illustrates how we can solve the problem through

**1. Greedy (Value density) Approach**

**2. Dynamic Programming with Recursion**
   
**3. Dynamic Programming without Recursion**

**4. Depth First Search**

The dynamic prgramming algorithm enables us to solve low to medium scale problem to optimality. However, as the scale of the problem increases, we will not able able to allocate sufficient space for the problem. Solving using dynamic programming with recursion allows us to solve it without the need for storing the data, however, that exponentially increaes the time for computation. In such cases, branch and bound algorithms could be employed.
